# To-Do List for Test Suite Enhancements

1. Add Logging to the Tests
Ensure all test methods have proper logging for test actions, results, and any relevant information for debugging.
2. Add Test Reports
Integrate a reporting tool (e.g., NUnit Test Results, ReportPortal, or Allure) to generate comprehensive test execution reports.
3. Verify Naming Conventions
Review and ensure all test methods and classes follow consistent and meaningful naming conventions (e.g., MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior).
4. Implement Error Handling
Add error handling to tests to gracefully manage failures, exceptions, and unexpected conditions during execution.
5. Read baseURL from Configuration File
Move the hardcoded baseURL to a configuration file (e.g., appsettings.json or environment variables) to make it more flexible for different environments.
6. Remove Unnecessary Usings Before Final Commits
Clean up the code by removing unused using directives to improve readability and maintainability.
7. Create README with Project Details and Quick Start
Write a README.md file that includes:
Project overview
Quick start guide for setting up and running tests
Key details about the tests and their purpose
Information on dependencies and how to install them
8. Ensure Tests Can Run with Minimum Configuration
Make sure the test suite can run with minimal configurations and all dependencies (e.g., libraries, packages) are automatically installed during the build process.
9. Create a Checklist.md Document
Develop a Checklist.md file that outlines essential steps for maintaining and reviewing the test suite. This should include:
Pre-commit checks
Test review guidelines
Dependency updates
10. Ensure Tests Donâ€™t Run if the API URL is Not Working
Implement a pre-check to verify that the API baseURL is accessible (e.g., a health check endpoint) before running the tests. Skip the tests if the URL is unreachable.
